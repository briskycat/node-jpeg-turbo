# node-tjpeg

*NOTE: this project is now obsolete. Either wait for https://github.com/sorccu/node-jpeg-turbo/pull/13 to be accepted upstream or use https://github.com/Julusian/node-jpeg-turbo instead.*

This is a fork of node-jpeg-turbo ported over to CMake.js so that it can be built with newer versions of jpeg-turbo, Node.js and Electron.
